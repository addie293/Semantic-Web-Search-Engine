-Generating data: You can find in convert2RDF folder the files.csv and the java codes that generate the RDFs from it.
-the Ontologies: you will find them in an link for image (draw io).
-The SparQl Queries : you can find them in the files with  Services.java (HospitalServices, CitiesServices, and StationServices).
-The Controllers : are just to allow you to see the data in the website.
-The files.java : those are file with an override method to use it during the code.
Note: the Limitation of showing the data is only because i have a big dataset.
Note: My dataset is HibaProject and you can find an export of it in the github (in my dataset i have data of Hospitals in France, data of France's cities and data for SnCF transportation)
the HTML files : "index" is the Home, "about" is for the hospital part , "services" is for the station part , "testimonials" is for the cities part and the "contact" for the contact page.
Note:
in hibaProject.rar you will find all the java codes and the Html, css , js files even the Queries will be found in it (like I mentioned in the 3rd line).
in The dataset.rar you will find the dataset (triples).
in Dynamic Data.java you will see the code to put the dynamic data for bikes.
